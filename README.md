### How to write "Hello world in Rust"
<br>

```

fn main(){
    println!("Hello, world!");
}

```
above is how to write hello world in rust and how to run it, can type "cargo run" and below the result

### a brief introduction to cargo in rust
Cargo is package manager default and build system in Rust.<br>
example of use cargo below: <br>
1. for make a new project in rust, we can write 

```

cargo new name_file

```
cargo will make with project structure below

belajar_rust/<br>
├── Cargo.toml<br>
└── src/<br>
└── main.rs

2. can run program as shown below

```
cargo run
```

3. Running test

```
cargo test
```

4. if wanna measure performance or release an application

```
cargo build --release
```
or

```
cargo run --release
```

Most rust programmer i think, spend 90% of their time using cargo run, then switch to
cargo build --release once the application is ready for development 
or performance testing

---
### Unit test
In Rust one project only can use one main function. i gonna use alternative methods is that "unit test"
<br>
a unit test is a code specifically dedicated to testing.

```
#[test]
fn testing(){
    println!(my name's ghen and i currently learn rust);
}
```

this is output, we can run with "cargo test name_test_function -- --exact" or can also "cargo test name_test_funciton -- --nocapture"
<br> but, first step jus run all unit test and won't show the output. so i often use second step

### Variable
A variable is used to store data values, to create or declare a variable in rust, we can use "let" keyword.
examples of its usage is shown below:

```
#[test]
fn variable(){
    let my_name = "Ghendida";
    println!("Hallo {} ", my_name);
}
```
and the output:

```
PS D:\Rust\basic_rust> cargo test variable -- --nocapture
   Compiling basic_rust v0.1.0 (D:\Rust\basic_rust)
    Finished `test` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.48s                                                                                                           
     Running unittests src\main.rs (target\debug\deps\basic_rust-4923d86b01c67cd4.exe)

running 1 test
Hallo Ghendida 
test variable ... ok
```

<b>In Rust, we cannot change a variable that has already been assigned, which is usually called immutable. However, 
Rust allows us to create variables that can be changed, known as mutable, and the keyword is let mut. </b>

<br>
examples for mutable variable is showns below

```
#[test]
fn variable_mutable(){
    let mut age_in_2025: i8 = 18;
    println!("my age in 2025 is {} ", age_in_2025);

    age_in_2025 = 19;
    println!("my age in 2026 is {} ", age_in_2025);
}
```

and the output:

```
PS D:\Rust\basic_rust> cargo test variable_mutable -- --nocapture
Compiling basic_rust v0.1.0 (D:\Rust\basic_rust)
Finished `test` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.49s                                                                                                           
Running unittests src\main.rs (target\debug\deps\basic_rust-4923d86b01c67cd4.exe)

running 1 test
my age in 2025 is 18
my age in 2026 is 19
test variable_mutable ... ok
```
